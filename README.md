## General Approach 

* Reviewed the technical requirements, necessary deliverables to achieve the project tasks
* Create my database and tables
* Create a ERD Diagram showing relations
* Utilized Spring Initializer to create a maven project 
* Used a monolith first because it is much easier to debug and test. In addition, I would be able to run end-to-end testing because its a single indivisble unit
* Created react-app(created components) (npm install react-router-dom, npm install, npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap)
* Styled the components


## Major Hurdles
* Connecting the frontend to the backend due to Cross-origin resource sharing(CORS) issue.
* Fetching the the api from the backend
* Understanding the basic concepts on state and props(passing props). 
* Microservices with Docker : Experienced errors with EntityFactoryManager when Eureka was added to my API
* Setting a concrete plan of tasks I wanted to complete each day throughout the project weeks


## User Stories
* As a user, I can create an account
* As a user, I can view a feed of posts created by other users that is related to tech and design
* As a user, I can find a mentor online based on skills that I need help with
* As a Mentor, I can support the development of others
